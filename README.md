# Ampelometry: a visualization of the global grapevine leaf morphospace

Using inference on nearly 25,000 grapevine leaves (download dataset here: https://zenodo.org/records/18057441) a UMAP based on the distance matrix calculated from the average of the Jaccard indices of the five segmentation classes (lobe midvein, lobes distal, lobes proximal, vein midvein, veins lateral).

You can toggle between dataset (and also select specific datasets to visualize), vein-to-blade area ratio, and solidity. If you click on an individual point you can visualize the original leaf.
